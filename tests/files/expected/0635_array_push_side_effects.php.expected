%s:18 PhanParamTooFewInternalUnpack Call with 1 or more arg(s) to \array_unshift(array &$array, $values, ...$vars) which requires 2 arg(s). This may throw an ArgumentCountError if there are too few args at runtime.
%s:18 PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentVariadicInternalUnpack Saw likely use of named arguments in argument unpacking for ...($something) of type \stdClass passed to an internal function \array_unshift(array &$array, $values, ...$vars). Except for a few internal methods that call methods/constructors dynamically, this is usually not supported by internal functions.
