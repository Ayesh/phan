%s:14 PhanDeprecatedPartiallySupportedCallable Saw deprecated partially supported callable self::triple. This was deprecated in PHP 8.2 and behaves inconsistently and can be called with call_user_func but not $callable() and the referenced class depends on context at call time. In some cases, [self::class, 'triple'] can be used instead.
