%s:3 PhanCompatibleNamedArgument Cannot use named arguments before php 8.0 in argument (a: 123)
%s:3 PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentVariadicInternal Passing named argument a: 123 to the variadic parameter of the internal function \var_dump($value, ...$values). Except for a few internal methods that call methods/constructors dynamically, this is usually not supported by internal functions.
%s:5 PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentVariadicInternalUnpack Saw likely use of named arguments in argument unpacking for ...($args) of type array{a-b:123} passed to an internal function \var_dump($value, ...$values). Except for a few internal methods that call methods/constructors dynamically, this is usually not supported by internal functions.
%s:5 PhanTypeMismatchUnpackKey When unpacking a value of type array{a-b:123}, the value's keys were of type string, but the keys should be consecutive integers starting from 0
%s:7 PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentVariadicInternalUnpack Saw likely use of named arguments in argument unpacking for ...([$key=>$key]) of type non-empty-array<string,string> passed to an internal function \var_dump($value, ...$values). Except for a few internal methods that call methods/constructors dynamically, this is usually not supported by internal functions.
