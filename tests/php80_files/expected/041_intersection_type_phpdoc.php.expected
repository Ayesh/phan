%s:16 PhanUnreferencedPublicMethod Possibly zero references to public method \A41::method()
%s:22 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($a) is [A41::class,'method'] of type array{0:'A41',1:'method'} but \test41() takes callable-object (no real type) defined at %s:8 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:22 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 2 ($b) is 'A41::method' of type 'A41::method' but \test41() takes callable-array&string[] (no real type) defined at %s:8 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:22 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 3 ($c) is (function) of type Closure():void but \test41() takes callable-string (no real type) defined at %s:8 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
